## General Information
- This project is to understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- The dataset is from consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
  1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company .
  2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- Dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011. It contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

## Conclusions
- Minimize issuing loans to small business.
- Avoid issuing loans where loan amount to annual income ratio is > 30%.
- LC should avoid considering loans with DTI > 20 or atleast should impose high interest rate so that number of applicants would be less.
- Reduce approving loans to applicants having previous bankruptcy records.
